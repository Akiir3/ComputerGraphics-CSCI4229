Homework 3
Erika Bailon
CSCI 4229 Fall 2019 

This homework draws WallE and Eva and a few buildings in the area. 
Sorry they don't have arms, they will for next homework! 

This assignment took me about 18 hours because it was hard understanding some new functions and it took me about 5 hours just fixing each body to all be created at the origin so rotation and translation could work without bugs. 

The key instructions are the following: 

esc		exits program
0		reset view angle 
up		change view angle up
down		change view angle down
left		change view angle left	
right		change view angle right
m         	Toggle between perspective and orthogonal
+/-        	Zooms in and out the field of view for perspective
a          	Toggle axes
