This project took about 12 hours, I did some research about what the Lorenz means and watched some videos of how 
to do in different languages. It was interesting seeing the output of differential equations in a way that I've 
never seen before. Also, I saw some tutorial of Lorenz in other languages and they outputted pretty cool designs, 
even some that were drawing themselves and other pretty cool features.
